# dayToDayToday
Just goofing around.

## Brainstorming:
- Something along the lines of a boring choose your own adventure.
- Presented with generated basic choices and story sort of elements.
	- These are basic day-to-day decisions.  Ex: Do I watch this movie or this one.
- Have it be minimalistic.  Pretty and text-based.  
- Start with a simple choose your own adventure where people can make decision graphs.

## Ideas:
- Have something that incorporates current events.
	- Back to the movie example, present a choice between two new movies that are new to theatres.
- Implement some tracking.
	- Maybe tie in some education about how time flies and to be conscious of what you choose to do?
